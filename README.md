## About Me

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Java and GDScript.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning Algorithms and how to program.
- ðŸ˜€ I enjoy anime, manga, gaming, and watching YouTube videos in my free time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"

## Projects

I usually update my programming projects on GitHub when I've made substantial progress. But for markdown files, I make smaller updates more frequently. Feel free to contribute to any of my projects by submitting a pull request.
