# Hi, I'm Prosper!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a student from South Africa, passionate about learning to code and creating cool projects.

## About Me

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Java, Swift, and SwiftUI.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning Algorithms and how to program.
- ðŸ˜€ I enjoy Anime, manga, gaming, and watching YouTube videos in my free time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"

## Projects

I usually update my programming projects on GitHub when I've made substantial progress. But for markdown files, I make smaller updates more frequently. Feel free to contribute to any of my projects by submitting a pull request.
